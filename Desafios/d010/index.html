But maybe you don't now that your kind mascot have a name and a history very curious? Then follow this article to learn a lot of things about this robot.</p>

        <h3 class="topic">The first version</h3>

        <p>The first try to create a mascot emerged in 2007 and came a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" class="link">Dan Morrill &#x1F517</a>. He tell that opened the <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" class="link">Inkscape &#x1F517</a> (free software for vectorization of images) and created your own version of robot. The objective it was just personalize the system just for your own team, did not exist any request of the company for a creation of a mascot</p>

        <p>That first odd version it was even baptized in honor of your creator: would be the Dandroids.</p>

        <h3 class="topic">Arise a new mascot</h3>

        <p>The idea of having a mascot was maturing and the mission was passed for a professional area. The russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com" class="link">Irina Blok &#x1F517</a>, also employee of Google, stayed with the mission to represent the little robot in a way more pleasant.</p>

            <img src="images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Woman">
        </picture>

        <p>The main idea of Irina was to represent all gratifying with little traits and in the form more flattened. The drawing also must generate a fast identification for who see. So arise the Bugdroid, the new mascot of Android.</p>

        <img class="center" src="images/bugdroid.png" alt="Android">

        <p>The main inspiration for the traits of the new Bugdroid came those little dolls that illustrate doors of bathrooms to indicate the gender of each door. Tell the legend that the artist was creating in your office desk in Google desktop and seen to the sides of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

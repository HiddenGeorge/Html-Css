        <p>I'm staying tired<br>
            Of such technology<br>
            Just talk by email<br>
            Short and cold messages<br>
            Twitter and Facebook<br>
            Before I expire<br>
            I will tell everything in poetry.</p>
        <div id="img001">
            <p>It's not more like was before<br>
                It's all abbreviated<br>
                "You" just have two letters<br>
                The "O" and the "E" was scratched<br>
                To declare the love<br>
                Just put a flower<br>
                And a drawed heart</p>
        </div>
        <p>Arroba now doesn't weight<br>
            It's a part of a address<br>
            Final period don't even used<br>
            Or will go to the start<br>
            Now is .com<br>
            If the site is very good<br>
            He cost a high price</p>
            
        <p>Worsen the language<br>
            The emoticom it's a risk<br>
            Have symbol for everything<br>
            Period and comma and a asterisk<br>
            A kiss mean<br>
            To learn how stay<br>
            Decrypt this scribble</p>
        <div id="img002">
            <p>I have longing of cards<br>
                Writed with the own hands<br>
                Sent in at the month of June<br>
                Just arrived in summer<br>
                But it killed the longing<br>
                It was true text<br>
                In the lines of heart</p>
        </div>
        <p>Now, I write and send<br>
            Arriving in the same hour<br>
            But when I will prose<br>
            The person left<br>
            Opened other app<br>
            The world became captive<br>
            Of technology of now</p>
            
        <p>Fortunately, to pray<br>
            Don't nedd the internet<br>
            God hear everyone<br>
            If you want, do this test<br>
            Two points is two knees<br>
            Your lips are gadgets<br>
            Let God interpreter</p>
